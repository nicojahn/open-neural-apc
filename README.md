## NOTICE: This branch is archived for documentation purposes only. The data, models and videos are deleted.

This repository (especially this branch) contains my original implementation of an RNN-based APC (Automated Passenger Counting) system.

This was the subject of my bachelor thesis "Counting People on Image Sequences Using Recurrent Neural Networks".

A newer, more basic implementation in TF 2.0 is going to be provided. A pre-trained (not optimal) model is delivered with a handful of test sequences. The bachelor thesis will be provided upon request.

Basic how to use:

```python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```
