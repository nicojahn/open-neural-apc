# open-neural-apc
This repository contains my original implementation of an RNN-based APC (Automated Passenger Counting) system. This was the subject of my bachelor thesis "Counting People on Image Sequences Using Recurrent Neural Networks". A newer, more basic implementation in TF 2.0 is going to be provided. A pre-trained (not optimal) model is delivered with a handful of test sequences. The bachelor thesis will be provided upon request.
